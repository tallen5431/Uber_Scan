# What has already been looked at

This file exists so the same ground is not dug twice. It records three things
and the middle one is the point:

1. **Done** — what was found and fixed, with the commit that did it.
2. **Settled** — proposals that were made, checked against the code, and found
   to be *wrong*. Re-proposing one of these costs a day. Each says why it died.
3. **Open** — findings that survived checking and are genuinely not done. These
   are known. Finding one again is not a discovery.

Everything below was checked against the real code rather than argued from the
outside, and the measurements are from a box roughly 5–8× faster than a Pi 4
unless they say otherwise. Where a decision has a home in the source, the
reasoning lives there too and this file only points at it.

## Settled — do not re-propose

### The journal read

**Do not window `/api/journal/newest`, `/api/journal/notes` or
`POST /api/journal/ingest`.** All three need every row in the file, and ingest
needs it absolutely: its idempotence is a `syncKey` set built over the whole
journal, so a windowed set stops recognising rows it has already stored and
appends them again on every sync tick — permanent corruption of the one artefact
that cannot be regenerated. `readJournal`'s own header records what a short set
did last time: 60 duplicate rows, `ok: true`, and a `have` that was wrong.
`newest` is the sync's reconciliation source (`have` over every row, `newest`
over every kindless row); `notes` filters each row's own `at` against a `since`
the *sender* chose, which is 0 under `sync.py --all`. The window belongs between
`readJournal` and the fold, which is where `rowsFor` now is.

**Do not add a chunked or streaming parse to cut memory.** Measured: `VmHWM`
equals `VmRSS` after a cold parse (362,580 kB vs 362,580 kB). There is no
transient spike above the retained rows to reclaim — the buffer, the string and
the split array are collected as the parse proceeds. It would add a state
machine to the one function that must never lose a row, for nothing.

**Do not make `readJournal` index-only** (a `syncKey` set for ingest, running
totals for newest, re-read for the rest). It is the only route to a real cut in
the ~305 MB of resident rows, and it turns "the journal, as rows" into three
derived indexes that must each stay true. `/api/journal?days=0` needs every row
anyway. If memory ever becomes an actual failure on the rig, cap the heap first:
`ExecStart=$NODE --max-old-space-size=400 …` in `rpi/install-service.sh` bounds
it without touching application code (measured: 381 MB → 301 MB, no OOM, no
measurable slowdown).

**Do not add a server-side cap on `days` or `limit`.** `tools/measure_places.js`
asks for `days=3650&limit=20000`, and the CSV link asks for `limit=0`
deliberately — see the comment at `journal.html` explaining that a ceiling is
still a cap. `days` must stay an honest span.

**Do not merge the three chart passes** over `offers` in `journal.html`. Each is
cheap and each is readable; merging saves a few ms on *All* and costs clarity.
The one exception was the day-of-week pass, which was discarded outright and is
now guarded.

**Do not narrow `Advice.busy` or the day grouping to the 300 rendered rows.**
The busy chip and its note describe the whole window, so a join over a sample
would make the sentence disagree with the list beneath it.

**Prewarming the parse at boot is not obviously right.** It moves a ~300 MB
allocation and several seconds of CPU into the one moment memory is tightest —
boot is when the scanner is starting Python, OpenCV and Tesseract. Do it only if
the first load after a reboot is reported as a real problem, and then delay it a
few seconds after `listen` rather than running it inline.

### The maps

**The map is not two presses from the phone by accident.** The cycle is
Phone → Scene → Map → Phone on one control, because the bottom bar holds six and
a seventh sheds one. A proposal to reorder or shortcut it misread what the code
does and was net-zero at best.

**`dropoffScanned` does not mean "read off the driver's phone".** A proposal to
distinguish card-read from phone-read dropoffs on the maps inverted what that
flag actually marks. Read the fold in `server.js` before building on it.

**Do not widen the detour to include where the new job ends.** It is
`car → pickup → where the order in the car is going`, because that order *has*
to be delivered; where the new job ends after that is a further guess. This is
already stated at the `mapLine` call site in `live.html`.

**Do not make "on your way" proportional** (e.g. a percentage of the route
rather than the half-mile cut-off). It would put a second geocoded number on the
panel for the driver to act on, which the header of `map-view.js` forbids.

**Do not run `straysAmong` against the median of two points** on `live.html`.
With a pickup and a dropoff the median *is* the midpoint, so both ends come out
equally far and **both are accused** — the good pin condemned beside the bad one.
Measured, not reasoned: `straysAmong` on such a pair returns 2. This is why
`MV.farFrom` exists and is anchored on the car's measured GPS fix instead; see
`map-view.js`. *(Done — the panel now marks the wrong pin and withholds the
figure. Before it, a misread street answered in Idaho produced "+3619.4 mi out
of your way" on the driving panel.)*

**Do not re-draw a stacked hop out of the dropoff the car had not reached.**
The proposal manufactures a confidently wrong number and proposes a check that
cannot fail.

**Per-place correction of a bad geocode was proposed twice and refused twice**
in its stated form — a button on the page the driver is not on, whose remedy
cannot change its own output. The *problem* is real and is listed under Open
below; it is the proposed cure that was wrong.

---

## Open — known, checked, not done

None of these are bugs on the road today. They are things worth doing that
nobody has done, listed so they are not rediscovered as news.

**The live map draws nothing until every lookup finishes.** At one geocoder
request a second that is several seconds of empty rectangle during a decision
measured in tens of seconds. Drawing the car first, then each place as it lands,
would put something useful on the glass immediately.

**The two dropoff pins are pixel-identical** — the held order's and this card's.
The thing the driver came to compare has to be told apart by clicking each dot.
`mapDot` already takes a `ring` flag that carries the right meaning.

**`judge()`'s "this cannot be right" uses a distance the rig already distrusted.**
Where `milesUncertain` is set there is no yardstick at all, so the pair should be
marked unjudged rather than accused; where `milesCorrected` is set the popup
should say the card's figure was corrected.

**The geocode cache does not sync to the NUC.** It is the one thing the owner
asked to sync that does not: `remember()` goes to real lengths to merge across
two *tabs* and does nothing across two *machines*, while the journal syncs both
ways.

**A wrong remembered lookup can only be fixed by wiping every good one.**
`map.html` is the one surface that can *identify* a bad geocode — the stray rows
are already listed and already tappable — and all it can do is throw the whole
cache away. (The cure proposed by the audit was refused; see Settled.)

**No map can be asked about a time.** `journal.html` already buckets every offer
by hour and by weekday; `map.html` has only a day count. A weekday plus
three-hour-block filter would make the map answer a question *before* a shift
rather than only after one — on the parked desk page, where the six-control panel
bar does not bind.

**The panel's caption row has a stated budget that one sentence in ten keeps.**
`live.html` writes the rule down — short, because the line is a row of the panel
— and then emits nine sentences up to 125 characters. Either cap the row and let
the map keep its height, or rewrite the nine.

## What has been swept, and when

| Area | Outcome |
|---|---|
| `map.html`, `live.html` map mode, the offer log's map sheet, `map-view.js` | 25 proposals, 14 survived checking, 11 refuted. Fixes in `06a6dd8`, `ebc80df`, `f5cfb96`, `c98f6fb`. |
| `readJournal` / `latestPerOffer` / every consumer of a journal read | 43 consumer claims mapped and verified. Fix in `d864163`. |
| `map.html` layout, on every panel, for the first time | Four faults on the first run. Fix in `d829bb9`. |
| The pin badge said "jobs" and counted offers | `4d0accc`. It says offers, and the popup keeps taken / passed on / never marked apart. |
| The offer log's map sheet named a colour that was not drawn | Fix in this commit: it names the pin that is there, the end that is missing, and which of the three kinds of missing it is. |
| The reader, the sync, the keypad, the ops scripts, `advice.js`, silent-failure paths repo-wide | 29 findings, adversarially verified. The first is recorded below; the rest are still being worked through. |

### The worst fault this sweep found

`one_card()` bounded the **legs** and nothing else. Every other field a card
states — the distance, the deadline, the item count, and the `Pickup` anchor
that names the merchant — went on reading the whole frame and taking the first
match anywhere on it, while the payout took the largest. On a frame holding two
cards that means the rig prices one card and describes the other. Measured, in
both ports:

| | pay | miles | items | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| top card alone | $8.00 | 0.6 | 4 | $50.85/hr go |
| bottom card alone | $14.00 | 9.4 | 12 | **$9.81/hr no** |
| both on one frame | $14.00 | 0.6 | 4 | **$90.85/hr go** |

A pass published as a green accept, spoken aloud, `is_whole()` so the rig stops
resampling, and written to the append-only journal carrying the wrong card's
distance, deadline, items and merchant. **30 of this driver's 272 cards** arrive
on a frame with two payout-sized amounts.

Fixed by `card_span`/`only_card`: the chosen card's words are the gap between
the two *neighbouring* payouts. That span had to work for both layouts in the
corpus, which print their figures on opposite sides of the money — anchoring on
the chosen payout itself is right for one and points straight at the neighbour
for the other.

Two facts about the rig that keep coming up and are worth not re-deriving, both
measured over the owner's own 272-card export:

- `find_address()` returns `None` on **all 272** texts, and no exported text
  contains a `, ST ZIP` anchor. Every one of those is an *offer card*, though —
  not the dropoff screen the driver taps — so whether it ever fires there is
  still open, and needs health lines from a real shift plus `--keep-scans`
  frames of a tapped screen to settle.
- **129 of 272** cards name no dropoff at all; 78 of those literally print
  "Customer dropoff". Any feature that needs a destination before accepting is
  designing for the minority case.
