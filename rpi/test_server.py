"""The server's own arithmetic, against the real server.

    python3 rpi/test_server.py

server.js is tested through the pages that use it — the offers page, the
driving screen, the sync — which is where its faults are seen. It leaves a
class of fault nothing was pointed at: the ones between two callers of the
same endpoint, or between two endpoints answering the same question. Two
journal reads in flight after one append; a body split across two TCP
segments; a count the offers page and the driving screen make differently for
one file; a status answer that disagrees with the event stream about the same
reading. Each of these was found by reading the code and then reproduced here,
and each check below failed before its fix.

Two servers: one with no scanner, for the journal and the body reader; one on
a fake scanner that reads a card, reads it again, then reads another, for the
order in the car.
